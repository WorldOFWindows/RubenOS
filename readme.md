A custom Windows:tm: modification for gaming and home-use
  
# Not in the works
This project is not in the works anymore. Please look into my incomming project. I have changed and I know now this is absolutley useless, execpt for giving me a hard lesson: Dont use a lot of useless tweaks and look into everything carefully. I learned that the hard way, and i'm going to reflect that in my incomming project. In the project i'm going to make a ISO with my entire brain knowledge and just **recommend** tweaks. I'll also make a full on guide, on how to optimize and make Windows perfect. A Linux Version is also in the works (I learned lots of things there and tried Gentoo (dont))

Well i hope this announcment helps you. I'll see you in the other side, at the next project. Have a nice day =)

  ## 1. What is RubenOS?
      
RubenOS is a modified version of Windows. It is designed to be good for home-use aswell of gaming use. Benchmarks are soon to come, dont worry. Alino and Pitachok are the brains of this operation. I, Alino, am writing this. I made a script (it tweaks the system) that is around **10.000** Lines long. Pretty impressive for me. There is also a Toolkit on the Desktop. It has a Installer for games and apps and a guide for drivers. RubenOS **dosen`t** contain any spyware, malware and i coded it in a good way. You can check the code, because as you can see, its Open-Source.  

RubenOS has a build in WinPE aswell. I`ll explain. If you boot to the Installation medium, you wont see your typical installation setup, instead you will boot into the WinPE, called WinRPE. WInRPE can be used to repair Windows, search the web and more. In the Desktop there will be a shortcut of the Windows Setup and if you open it, you will be ready to install RubenOS.
  
  ### 1.1 Why does it exist?
  
Boredom. I/We didnt know what to do in life or do something to make a hit and make us known. This is our idea. We dont care about money, maybe donations, but we give all products for free. Also I wanted to create something so yeah. RubenOS was creeated.
